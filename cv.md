## About me

I taught electrical engineering to students at a technical university for many years, trying to make study fun. However, over time, teaching became routine, and I wanted to find a new path for myself.

Now my interests are information technology, vector graphics and popular science. At my current workplace I can realize these interests. I like my job, but I get a little tired of the daily holiday atmosphere that is also part of it.

_I adore smart, calm people and I adhere to the philosophy of slow living._

I'm starting my adventure with Linux now. The magic spell "Ctrl+Alt+T" gives me, a newbie, a sense of control over the situation. This is very cool at a time when there are so many reasons for stress around.

A couple of years ago web design entered my life. I completed three stages of the front-end course at RS School. It's not easy, but it's very exciting!

Now my goal is learn how to write laconic clean JS-code and find a worthy use for my skills.
